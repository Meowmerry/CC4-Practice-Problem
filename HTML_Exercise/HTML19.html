        <h2>JSX is an Expression Too</h2>
        "After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.

        This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as
        arguments, and return it from functions:
        Donâ€™t put quotes around curly braces when embedding a JavaScript expression in an attribute. You should either
        use quotes (for string values) or curly braces (for expressions), but not both in the same attribute."

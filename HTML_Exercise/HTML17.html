    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with
        React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the
        full power of JavaScript.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next
        section. Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.</p>

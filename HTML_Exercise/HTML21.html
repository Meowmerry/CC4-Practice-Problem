        <dt>Add React to a Website</dt>
        <dd>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as
            you need. Perhaps you only want to add some “sprinkles of interactivity” to an existing page. React
            components are a great way to do that.</dd>

        <dt>Add React in One Minute</dt>
        <dd>In this section, we will show how to add a React component to an existing HTML page. You can follow along
            with your own website, or create an empty HTML file to practice.</dd>

        <dt>Step 1: Add a DOM Container to the HTML</dt>
        <dd>First, open the HTML page you want to edit. Add an empty tag to mark the spot where you want to display
            something with React. For example:</dd>

        <dt>Step 2: Add the Script Tags</dt>
        <dd>The first two tags load React. The third one will load your component code.

        </dd>

        <dt>Step 3: Create a React Component</dt>
        <dd>Create a file called like_button.js next to your HTML page.

            Open this starter code and paste it into the file you created.</dd>

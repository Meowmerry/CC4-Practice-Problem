        <h1>Understanding Book Metadata</h1>
        <p>
            There are several things to consider in order to help
            <u>your book </u> achieve its greatest potential discoverability.

            <u>librarians, and retailers can't purchase a book
                they can't find, and your book metadata is responsible </u>
            for whether or not your book pops up when they type
            in search terms relevant to your book. <b>Book metadata</b>
            may sound complicated, but it consists of all the information
            that describes your book, including: your title, subtitle,
            series name, price, trim size, author name, book description,
            and more. <b><i>There are two metadata fields</i></b> for your
            short book description. Although both play a role in
            driving traffic to your book, they have <i>distinct differences. </i>
